# Product brief

## Problem
Blocking numbers is ineffective because scammers spoof new numbers. Social engineering attacks (fake bank support, IRS threats, tech support, etc.) still cost victims billions because there is no real-time defense while the scam is happening.

## Solution
Guardkall is an AI interceptor for live calls. The user merges Guardkall into a suspicious call. Guardkall listens silently. If it detects financial threats or urgent demands, it un-mutes, hijacks the conversation with a time-waster persona, and the user hangs up safely.

## Core user flow
1) User receives a suspicious call.
2) User taps "Add Call" and dials the Guardkall number.
3) Guardkall joins as a third party and begins silent monitoring.
4) Real-time analysis classifies the call (safe vs scam).
5) If scam detected, Guardkall interrupts and deploys a time-waster persona.
6) The user ends their participation; Guardkall keeps the scammer occupied.

- Victim: non-technical, wants a safe, simple way to avoid scams.
